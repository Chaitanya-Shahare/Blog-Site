So, I&amp;rsquo;ll be sharing my Budget, Minimal Desk setup in my hostel room at the National Institute of Technology Srinagar (NITSRI).
Things to keep in mind As this is a hostel room setup can&amp;rsquo;t have anything expensive as it can be damaged and budget of course. It shouldn&amp;rsquo;t occupy much space as hostel rooms are pretty small and you have to share them with others.</description>
