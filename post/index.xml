My journey with Visual Studio Code (VS Code) has been on and off ever since I started to code, you can read more about that here.
But for some or the other reason I keep coming back to it. I feel that the only reason I think that I&amp;rsquo;m faster in neovim is the customisability of it, the ability to do anything as I like to do. Not getting adapted to the workflows but creating them as they are suited to me.</description>
