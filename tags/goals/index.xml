      <description>Take a clean sheet of paper and write down Goals and today&amp;rsquo;s date. Write down 10 goals that you want to accomplish in the next 12 months ( write these goals in the present tense ) eg. I earn &amp;hellip;, I achieve &amp;hellip; Take this list of 10 and then you say, &amp;lsquo;If I had a magic wand and I could wave this magic wand and I could have any one goal on my list within 24 hours, which one goal would have the greatest positive impact on my life?</description>
